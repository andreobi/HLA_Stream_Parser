The stream parser is a tool to put a stream into data packets. A packet start could be an idle time and/or a specific sequence of charaters. The stream parser can handle upto 4 different headers with 1 - 8 bytes lenght. In addition to that there is a generic header mask (bit set to 0) to ignore header bit. Some measured data streams are bidirectional and have a special bit inside the header to enable the client to send data. That kind of r/w bit could be detected with the trigger mask. When the stream value & trigger mask equals the trigger value, the trigger time max time is set at the packet end to check if the next stream data is or isn't on time. The result is shown in the frame bubble.

The stream parser can handle diffrent packet length sources. 
- You can detrement a specific length: Packet fix length: all packets shall have the same length
- A length can be determent by the packet itself. There is also a length mask to filter the stream data for specific bits.
The length fix parameter it an option to limit the data interpretation length of a packet, further bytes are just handled as a padding.

The current crc implementation is very limited, but it should be easy to extend the program with your crc routine. 

A stream packet can contain the following parts:
- Time to Packet: before a new packet start, it looks for an idle time in ms, max=1s
- Preamble      : number of unchecked bytes
- Header        : 0-8 bytes, no need to insert ending '0'; left aligned like the incoming stream
- Header Pad    : number of unchecked bytes
- Length        : 0-2 bytes to specify the packet length; 0 => the menu 'length fix' is used  
- Length Pad    : number of unchecked bytes
- DATA          : number = packet length - options
- Data Pad      : number of unchecked bytes (is not part of crc)
- Crc           : 0-4 bytes crc checksum
- Crc Pad       : number of unchecked bytes to reach packet end
- Packed Pad    : the left over if a fixed packed length is behind Crc Pad (packet_fix_length - length)

- Header Mask   : Stream bytes and mask == Header and mask? if mask==0 => everything is a match
- Tigger Mask   : is operated to the stream header if the
- Tigger Value  : Header and Trigger Mask == Trigger Value and Trigger Mask => Trigger set
- Trigger Time Max  : if Trigger Set: Trigger Time starts at packet end => True next frame before Tmax
- Packet timeout    : resets the current parsing in ms
- Packet fix length : specifies the total packet length
- Length fix        : if Length == 0 => specifies the length for data and crc
- Length Offset     : can be used to adjust the data length

flex search means the header length is determent by the header value input, inputs can have different lengths
- Time_to_Packet == 0, Header_length == 0,  => Packet starts after flex Header match
- Time_to_Packet == 0, Header_length >  0,  => Packet starts after fix Header length match
- Time_to_Packet >  0, Header_length == 0,  => Packet starts after Time to Header (Idle)
- Time_to_Packet >  0, Header_length >  0,  => Packet starts after Idle and fix Header length match

- Time_to_Packet == 0, Header_length == 0,  Header_value      => Packet starts after Idle
- a double P-End indicates that the packet length is shorter than the packet definition

A pad(ding) is used to jump over packet bytes which can't be handled by this parser
 
There are almost no plausibility check => define '....' and you get something

New CRC definition options
It is now possible to define the following parameters for a crc
- crc type 8, 16 or 32 bits
- start value
- finalize value
- polymon value
- mirror for input and final output
the crc intermediate result is shown for each byte

open topics
- error handling e.g. Stream error
  so fare there was no need to handle errors - nothing planed on this topic

topics that could be improved
- output after timeout and potential header
